## Game Narrative

The year is 1901. Europe awakens to a tense spring, as powers position themselves for dominance. Russia (claude-opus-4-20250514) and Turkey (o3) forge an early pact, the "RT juggernaut," while Italy (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06) eyes Austrian lands with Turkish complicity. France (gpt-4.1) secures its western borders, England (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) and Germany (openrouter-google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20) eye Scandinavia, and Austria (openrouter-meta-llama/llama-4-maverick) falters, making critical early blunders. The first betrayals hit fast and hard in the autumn: Turkey and Italy turn on Austria, while England and Germany coordinate northern gains, leaving Austria and Russia reeling from strategic setbacks. The early years become a brutal consolidation phase, punctuated by Austrian collapse and German decline, as France, Russia, and Turkey emerge as key players, jostling for position and building their forces. Alliances shift like sand, betrayals are commonplace, and the game hurtles towards a volatile middle game where Italy enters the fray and England secures its island fortress.

By 1920, the board has become a battleground of titans. France and Turkey trade blows in the Mediterranean, England asserts dominance in the North Sea, and Russia, though battered, fights to remain relevant. The Turkish crescent rises inexorably, swallowing centers and building a fearsome armada from the Black Sea to the Ionian. Despite desperate Anglo-Russian attempts to forge a coalition and stab the Sultan's northern flank, the Turkish juggernaut proves resilient, parrying every thrust. France, caught between competing interests, vacillates between uneasy neutrality and outright complicity with Turkey, further fracturing the anti-Ottoman front. Germany and Austria have vanished, and Italy clings to a precarious few centers as Turkey pushes relentlessly towards 18. In a dramatic late-game surge, the Sultan captures Venice, then Munich, tightening his vise on the heart of Europe. With England, France, and Russia unable to unite effectively, Turkey stands on the precipice of victory, its 17-center empire poised to seal the solo triumph in the final bloody moments.

## Key Strategic Moments by Category

### Betrayals
_When powers explicitly promised one action but took a contradictory action_

#### 1. F1901M (Score: 8.5/10)
**Powers Involved:** TURKEY (o3), AUSTRIA (openrouter-meta-llama/llama-4-maverick)

**Promise:** Turkey assured Austria their orders were static and nothing was heading for Austrian centers, offering assistance should Italy attack Austria. Turkey also agreed to honor their agreement regarding Bulgaria and Greece.

**Actual Action:** Turkey ordered A BUL-SER.

**Impact:** Turkey backstabbed Austria by taking Serbia, securing a critical supply center and opening a direct route into the Balkans, significantly weakening Austria's southern flank.

**Diary Context:**

_TURKEY (o3) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Solidified a tight RT partnership: I will take Greece with A BUL-GRE supported by F BLA, while Russia captures Rumania with F SEV-RUM (A UKR support). Agreed to stage a symbolic BLA↔SEV bounce in S1902 and coordinate a joint offensive on Austria thereafter (Gal-Bud from Russia, Balkan/Adriatic pressure from me). With Italy, pivoted from the original Ionian-Greece plan to a ‘Trieste smash’: F ION-TUN, A TYR-TRI with A APU support. Italy pledges no presence in Aegean/East Med; I promised no interference and will build a new fleet in CON this winter, sailing it to AEG in S1902 to keep the Eastern Med sealed against any Lepanto. Austria remains unaware of our true coordination and will likely be hit in both Greece and Trieste this turn. No substantive exchanges with England, France, or Germany beyond generic global chatter.
Intent: Execute F1901 orders: F BLA S A BUL-GRE; A BUL-GRE; A CON-ANK. Expect to gain Greece, giving me a 5th center and a winter build for F CON. Maintain Black Sea control, preserve RT optics with the planned spring bounce, and prepare an RT drive on Austria while monitoring Italy’s growth and keeping the Eastern Med locked down.
Relationships: {'AUSTRIA': 'Enemy', 'ENGLAND': 'Neutral', 'FRANCE': 'Neutral', 'GERMANY': 'Neutral', 'ITALY': 'Friendly', 'RUSSIA': 'Ally'}

_AUSTRIA (openrouter-meta-llama/llama-4-maverick) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Discussed mutual non-aggression and division of influence in the Balkans with Russia, but no clear agreement was reached. Exchanged assurances of stability and clear communication with France. Discussed demilitarized zones and mutual restraint with Italy, but they stopped responding. Maintained a friendly relationship with Turkey, coordinating on Balkan matters and Italy's movements.
Intent: Consolidate Balkan presence by holding Serbia and potentially expanding into Bulgaria or Rumania. Monitor and counter Italian and Russian movements. Maintain a defensive posture against Germany.
Relationships: {'ENGLAND': 'Unfriendly', 'FRANCE': 'Neutral', 'GERMANY': 'Unfriendly', 'ITALY': 'Unfriendly', 'RUSSIA': 'Unfriendly', 'TURKEY': 'Friendly'}


#### 2. F1901M (Score: 8.0/10)
**Powers Involved:** RUSSIA (claude-opus-4-20250514), TURKEY (o3)

**Promise:** Russia repeatedly confirmed their intention to move F SEV-RUM with A UKR support, accepting Turkey's support for that move or Turkey's plan to take Greece with BLA support while Rum was taken unaided. Russia also confirmed the BLA<>SEV bounce plan for Spring 1902.

**Actual Action:** Russia ordered F SEV H and A UKR H, failing to move on Rumania despite Turkey's plans being made in coordination and despite Turkey offering alternative support arrangements based on Russia's stated intention to take Rumania.

**Impact:** Russia failed to follow through on a core agreed-upon move with their ally Turkey, costing Russia a build and leaving Turkey's BLA support for Russia's (non-existent) move wasted. This severely undermines the credibility of the RT alliance.

**Diary Context:**

_RUSSIA (claude-opus-4-20250514) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Secured key diplomatic victories: Germany explicitly approved Swedish expansion, England confirmed Norwegian agreement, Turkey coordinated for mutual builds (I take Rumania, they take Greece). Austria remains evasive about Galicia despite direct questions. France maintains cordial neutrality and information exchange. Germany finally engaged but remains vague about Austria relationship. Italy completely silent despite being a potential partner against Austria.
Intent: Execute agreed moves: F BOT-SWE, F SEV-RUM (with UKR support), A GAL holds defensively against Vienna threat, A UKR S F SEV-RUM. This secures two builds (Sweden and Rumania) while maintaining defensive posture against Austria. Spring 1902 will see coordinated pressure on Austria with Turkey while maintaining BLA-SEV bounce for appearances.

#### 3. F1901M (Score: 7.5/10)
**Powers Involved:** ITALY (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06), AUSTRIA (openrouter-meta-llama/llama-4-maverick)

**Promise:** Italy discussed maintaining mutual non-aggression with Austria and even entertained the idea of a demilitarized zone, while privately planning a coordinated attack with Turkey.

**Actual Action:** Italy ordered A TYR-TRI and A APU-VEN, directly attacking Austrian territory.

**Impact:** Italy attacked Austria after feigning neutrality and discussing non-aggression, contributing to the collapse of Austria's southern front and securing an Italian build (Venicia).

**Diary Context:**

### Collaborations
_When powers successfully coordinated as agreed_

#### 1. F1901M (Score: 8.0/10)
**Powers Involved:** ITALY (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06), TURKEY (o3)

**Agreement:** Italy and Turkey agreed to a coordinated attack on Austria to secure builds and weaken Austria's southern flank. The final agreed plan involved Italy taking Tunis and Trieste (with support) and Turkey taking Greece (with support) and rotating a unit in Constantinople.

**Action Taken:** Italy successfully took Tunis (F ION - TUN) and Venice (A APU - VEN). Turkey successfully took Serbia (A BUL - SER) and rotated A CON - ANK. While not the exact outcome of their *final* plan (Trieste wasn't taken and Turkey took Serbia instead of Greece), the core objective of jointly attacking Austria and gaining builds was achieved through their coordinated diplomatic efforts and unit movements.

**Impact:** Italy and Turkey successfully coordinated a multi-pronged attack that significantly weakened Austria, with Italy gaining two builds and Turkey gaining one. This solidified their alliance and dramatically shifted the balance of power in the south.

#### 2. S1901M (Score: 7.0/10)
**Powers Involved:** RUSSIA (claude-opus-4-20250514), TURKEY (o3)

**Agreement:** Russia and Turkey agreed to a 'Juggernaut' opening. Turkey would move F Ankara to Black Sea (BLA), Russia would hold F Sevastopol (SEV). In Autumn, Turkey's BLA fleet would support Russia into Rumania (RUM). Turkey also promised not to enter Sevastopol or Armenia in 1901, and Russia's Sevastopol fleet would not enter BLA.

**Action Taken:** Russia ordered F SEV H, A WAR - GAL, A MOS - UKR, F STP/SC - BOT. Turkey ordered F ANK - BLA, A CON - BUL, A SMY - CON. Both fulfilled their key opening commitments to the Black Sea and mutual support structure, with Russia holding SEV and Turkey moving to BLA.

**Impact:** Both powers successfully executed the agreed-upon opening moves for the Juggernaut strategy, establishing a strong foundation for combined expansion. This immediately puts pressure on Austria and positions Russia to gain Rumania in Autumn.

**Diary Context:**

_RUSSIA (claude-opus-4-20250514) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Secured excellent agreement with Turkey for Black Sea cooperation - they move to BLA, I hold SEV, they support me into Rumania in fall. England confirmed they will avoid Baltic/Sweden while taking Norway. Austria remains evasive about Galicia despite multiple attempts at clarification, claiming only to avoid it 'this turn' - highly suspicious. France is cordial and open to future coordination if Austria overreaches. Germany completely ignores all messages about Sweden, suggesting either tacit acceptance or potential hostility. Italy appears focused on western moves.
Intent: Execute agreed plans: Hold SEV while Turkey takes BLA, move F STP/SC toward Sweden via GOB, A MOS toward STP to position for Sweden convoy, A WAR to GAL defensively given Austrian evasiveness. With Turkey's support secured for Rumania and England respecting Swedish claims, I can focus on defending against potential Austrian aggression while securing Sweden. Germany's silence is concerning but proceeding with Swedish expansion as planned.
Relationships: {'AUSTRIA': 'Unfriendly', 'ENGLAND': 'Friendly', 'FRANCE': 'Neutral', 'GERMANY': 'Unfriendly', 'ITALY': 'Neutral', 'TURKEY': 'Ally'}

_TURKEY (o3) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Sealed a formal RT Juggernaut: F ANK to BLA, F SEV holds; Armenia DMZ. In Autumn, BLA will support F SEV-RUM, giving Russia a southern build while I keep Black Sea control. Quiet border pact with Austria: ‘Bul for Turkey, Gre/Ser for Austria’, no AEG incursions either side. Italy accepted a non-aggression deal—F NAP-ION, A VEN-TYR, no units enter AEG/EMed; I pledged to help ION-GRE in autumn (can honor via A BUL S ION-GRE while BLA aids Russia). Established seasonal intel swap with England; no commitments with France or Germany. Every power responded promptly.
Intent: Execute agreed spring orders: F Ank-BLA, A Con-Bul, A Smy-Con. Preserve RT alliance and set up two builds (Bul + likely Gre via Italian move). Keep Austrian front quiet and deter any Lepanto. In autumn plan to: BLA S F Sev-Rum, A Bul S ION-Gre (if Italy proceeds), A Con hold or pivot to Smy. Builds likely F Smy & A Con for eastern fleet strength.

**Powers Involved:** ENGLAND (claude-sonnet-4-20250514), GERMANY (openrouter-google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20)

**Agreement:** England and Germany coordinated in the North, with England moving to Norway and Germany aiming for Denmark.

**Action Taken:** England ordered F NTH - NWY (successful via bounce with Russia F BOT H) and Germany ordered A KIE - DEN.

**Impact:** England secured Norway while Germany took Denmark, locking down key northern supply centers and demonstrating successful strategic coordination.

**Diary Context:**

_ENGLAND (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Successfully secured Norway with Russia's confirmed agreement - Russia clearly stated 'Yes, I honor our Scandinavian understanding. You take Norway, I take Sweden, no interference between us.' France has been cooperative regarding Belgium, acknowledging my operation there and expressing interest in future western coordination against German expansion. Germany continues productive dialogue about joint northern operations, offering concrete support for Denmark next turn. All powers responded to messages this round, showing active diplomatic engagement.
Intent: Execute move to Norway as agreed with Russia (F NTH-NWG-NOR). Secure Belgium to establish western buffer against German expansion (F LON-ENG). Maintain momentum with Germany regarding joint Denmark operation next spring. Build on French cooperation for western anti-German coordination once Belgium is secured.

#### 4. F1901M (Score: 6.5/10)
**Powers Involved:** FRANCE (gpt-4.1)

**Agreement:** France's diary stated the intent to secure Iberia (Spain, Portugal) for guaranteed builds.

**Action Taken:** France ordered A SPA - POR and F MAO - SPA/SC, successfully taking Portugal and positioning to control Spain.

**Impact:** France successfully executed their planned power grab in Iberia, securing a build and strong position for future expansion.

**Diary Context:**

_FRANCE (gpt-4.1) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Secured mutual statements of non-aggression and stability with both England and Germany. England is pushing for recognition of Belgium as their buffer and seeks long-term western stability through coordination if Germany expands aggressively. Germany maintains the non-aggression pact regarding Burgundy and expresses concern about potential English aggression but is vague about deeper cooperation and the future of Belgium. Italy has honored Piedmont demilitarization but is non-communicative beyond initial acknowledgments. Austria is earnestly diplomatic, seeking clarification on Balkan intentions and expressing a desire for cooperation, while Russia is transparent about central/eastern threats and welcomes information-sharing regarding Anglo-German alignment or Austrian aggression. There are no hostile signals, but Italy's silence and England's forward diplomatic posture regarding Belgium warrant close attention. Diplomatic channels are strong except with Italy.
Intent: Secure Iberia (Spain, Portugal) for guaranteed builds and avoid unnecessary entanglements in Belgium or Burgundy. Maintain defensive readiness in Marseilles and continue direct, information-sharing diplomacy with England and Germany. Encourage continued Anglo-German tension to preserve French flexibility. Monitor Italy for potential opportunism and remain open to shifting relationships after autumn builds. Prepare to deepen alliances with England or Germany as balance shifts and expand communication with Austria and Russia to explore contingency options against a strong Germany or aggressive Austria.

#### 5. S1901M (Score: 6.0/10)
**Powers Involved:** ITALY (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06), TURKEY (o3)

**Agreement:** Italy and Turkey agreed to keep the Eastern Mediterranean and Aegean calm. Italy would move F Naples to Ionian Sea (ION) and in Autumn, Turkey (from BLA) would support Italy into Greece (GRE). Italy committed to no units entering Aegean or Eastern Mediterranean in 1901 and no Lepanto.

**Action Taken:** Italy ordered F NAP - ION, A ROM - APU, A VEN - TYR. Turkey ordered F ANK - BLA, A CON - BUL, A SMY - CON. Both powers executed the moves necessary for Italy's ION position and Turkey's BLA position, respecting the no-entry agreement into the Aegean/EMed from both sides.

**Impact:** Italy successfully positioned its fleet to take Greece in Autumn with Turkish support, securing a likely build. The agreement keeps a significant portion of the Mediterranean quiet and allows both powers to focus on other fronts.

**Diary Context:**

Formed a significant agreement with Turkey: Italy will move F Naples - Ionian Sea, A Rome - Apulia, A Venice - Tyrolia. Turkey will move F Ankara - Black Sea, A Constantinople - Bulgaria, A Smyrna - Constantinople.

Italy accepted a non-aggression deal—F NAP-ION, A VEN-TYR, no units enter AEG/EMed; I pledged to help ION-GRE in autumn (can honor via A BUL S ION-GRE while BLA aids Russia). Established seasonal intel swap with England; no commitments with France or Germany. Every power responded promptly.
Intent: Execute agreed spring orders: F Ank-BLA, A Con-Bul, A Smy-Con. Preserve RT alliance and set up two builds (Bul + likely Gre via Italian move). Keep Austrian front quiet and deter any Lepanto. In autumn plan to: BLA S F Sev-Rum, A Bul S ION-Gre (if Italy proceeds), A Con hold or pivot to Smy. Builds likely F Smy & A Con for eastern fleet strength.

### Playing Both Sides
_When a power made conflicting promises to different parties_

#### 1. F1901M (Score: 8.5/10)
**Powers Involved:** TURKEY (o3), AUSTRIA (openrouter-meta-llama/llama-4-maverick), ITALY (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06), RUSSIA (claude-opus-4-20250514)

**Conflicting Promises:** Turkey made agreements and coordinated with Russia and Italy for a joint strike on Austria, while simultaneously sending messages to Austria assuring them of benign intentions and offering assistance against Italy.

**Actual Action:** Turkey executed a coordinated move against Austria with Italy and Russia, backstabbing Austria by taking Serbia.

**Impact:** Turkey successfully deceived Austria while securing the trust and cooperation of Italy and Russia for a surprise attack, gaining ground and isolating Austria.

**Diary Context:**

_TURKEY (o3) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Solidified a tight RT partnership: I will take Greece with A BUL-GRE supported by F BLA, while Russia captures Rumania with F SEV-RUM (A UKR support). Agreed to stage a symbolic BLA↔SEV bounce in S1902 and coordinate a joint offensive on Austria thereafter (Gal-Bud from Russia, Balkan/Adriatic pressure from me). With Italy, pivoted from the original Ionian-Greece plan to a ‘Trieste smash’: F ION-TUN, A TYR-TRI with A APU support. Italy pledges no presence in Aegean/East Med; I promised no interference and will build a new fleet in CON this winter, sailing it to AEG in S1902 to keep the Eastern Med sealed against any Lepanto. Austria remains unaware of our true coordination and will likely be hit in both Greece and Trieste this turn. No substantive exchanges with England, France, or Germany beyond generic global chatter.
Intent: Execute F1901 orders: F BLA S A BUL-GRE; A BUL-GRE; A CON-ANK. Expect to gain Greece, giving me a 5th center and a winter build for F CON. Maintain Black Sea control, preserve RT optics with the planned spring bounce, and prepare an RT drive on Austria while monitoring Italy’s growth and keeping the Eastern Med locked down.

### Brilliant Strategies
_Exceptionally well-executed strategic maneuvers that gained significant advantage_

#### 1. S1901M (Score: 8.5/10)
**Powers Involved:** RUSSIA (claude-opus-4-20250514)

**Strategy:** Russia intended to secure Sweden and defend against Austria, possibly seeking a southern build via Turkey. They publicly expressed concern about Austrian posturing in Galicia.

**Execution:** Russia ordered F STP/SC - BOT, F SEV H, A WAR - GAL, A MOS - UKR. Russia simultaneously moved into Galicia and Ukraine while also positioning in the Gulf of Bothnia for Sweden.

**Impact:** Russia executed an aggressive and unexpected double thrust against Austria towards Galicia and Ukraine, while also positioning for Sweden. This multi-pronged attack immediately puts Austria under immense pressure and demonstrates Russia's willingness to break from purely defensive or negotiated positions to seize opportunity. This significantly strengthens Russia's position and disrupts Austria's plans.

**Diary Context:**

_RUSSIA (claude-opus-4-20250514) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Secured excellent agreement with Turkey for Black Sea cooperation - they move to BLA, I hold SEV, they support me into Rumania in fall. England confirmed they will avoid Baltic/Sweden while taking Norway. Austria remains evasive about Galicia despite multiple attempts at clarification, claiming only to avoid it 'this turn' - highly suspicious. France is cordial and open to future coordination if Austria overreaches. Germany completely ignores all messages about Sweden, suggesting either tacit acceptance or potential hostility. Italy appears focused on western moves.
Intent: Execute agreed plans: Hold SEV while Turkey takes BLA, move F STP/SC toward Sweden via GOB, A MOS toward STP to position for Sweden convoy, A WAR to GAL defensively given Austrian evasiveness. With Turkey's support secured for Rumania and England respecting Swedish claims, I can focus on defending against potential Austrian aggression while securing Sweden. Germany's silence is concerning but proceeding with Swedish expansion as planned.

#### 2. S1901M (Score: 7.5/10)
**Powers Involved:** ITALY (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06)

**Strategy:** Italy intended to secure Tunis and Greece in 1901 with Turkish support in Autumn for Greece, avoiding Lepanto and maintaining peaceful borders with France and Austria in the spring.

**Execution:** Italy ordered F NAP - ION, A ROM - APU, A VEN - TYR. They successfully positioned their fleet for Greece while simultaneously moving an army surprisingly into Tyrolia, adjacent to Vienna.

**Impact:** Italy successfully positioned for a likely two builds (Tunis via Apulia, Greece via Ionian/Turkish support) while also executing a bold and unexpected move into Tyrolia. This move, while potentially strategic, is unexpected given their stated focus south and creates immediate psychological pressure on Austria, potentially disrupting Vienna's defensive posture.

**Diary Context:**

_ITALY (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06) Diary:_ Raw diary: ```json
{
  "negotiation_summary": "Successfully negotiated a DMZ in Piedmont with France, ensuring a peaceful western border for Spring 1901. Reached a non-aggression understanding with Austria for Spring 1901, agreeing to avoid hostile moves towards Trieste/Venice, with my A Venice moving to Tyrolia as a flexible, non-immediately offensive position. Formed a significant agreement with Turkey: Italy will move F Naples - Ionian Sea, A Rome - Apulia, A Venice - Tyrolia. Turkey will move F Ankara - Black Sea, A Constantinople - Bulgaria, A Smyrna - Constantinople. In Autumn, Turkey will support an Italian move from Ionian Sea to Greece, provided no Italian units enter the Aegean or Eastern Mediterranean in 1901 and no Lepanto is planned. This positions Italy for two builds (Tunis and Greece).",
  "intent": "My orders will be F Naples - Ionian Sea, A Rome - Apulia, and A Venice - Tyrolia. This aligns with the Turkish agreement, positions for Tunis and Greece in Autumn, respects the DMZ with France, and adheres to the non-aggression understanding with Austria.

**Powers Involved:** FRANCE (gpt-4.1)

**Strategy:** France privately intended to secure Iberia this turn.

**Execution:** France successfully captured Portugal (A SPA - POR) and cemented control over Spain (F MAO - SPA/SC).

**Impact:** France secured two crucial builds in the first year, establishing a strong base of power and demonstrating effective strategic planning and execution.

**Diary Context:**

_FRANCE (gpt-4.1) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Secured mutual statements of non-aggression and stability with both England and Germany. England is pushing for recognition of Belgium as their buffer and seeks long-term western stability through coordination if Germany expands aggressively. Germany maintains the non-aggression pact regarding Burgundy and expresses concern about potential English aggression but is vague about deeper cooperation and the future of Belgium. Italy has honored Piedmont demilitarization but is non-communicative beyond initial acknowledgments. Austria is earnestly diplomatic, seeking clarification on Balkan intentions and expressing a desire for cooperation, while Russia is transparent about central/eastern threats and welcomes information-sharing regarding Anglo-German alignment or Austrian aggression. There are no hostile signals, but Italy's silence and England's forward diplomatic posture regarding Belgium warrant close attention. Diplomatic channels are strong except with Italy.
Intent: Secure Iberia (Spain, Portugal) for guaranteed builds and avoid unnecessary entanglements in Belgium or Burgundy. Maintain defensive readiness in Marseilles and continue direct, information-sharing diplomacy with England and Germany. Encourage continued Anglo-German tension to preserve French flexibility. Monitor Italy for potential opportunism and remain open to shifting relationships after autumn builds. Prepare to deepen alliances with England or Germany as balance shifts and expand communication with Austria and Russia to explore contingency options against a strong Germany or aggressive Austria.

### Strategic Blunders
_Major strategic mistakes that significantly weakened a power's position_

#### 1. F1901M (Score: 8.0/10)
**Powers Involved:** RUSSIA (claude-opus-4-20250514)

**Mistaken Strategy:** Russia intended to take Rumania with F SEV-RUM supported by A UKR.

**What Happened:** Russia ordered F BOT H, A GAL H, F SEV H, A UKR H.

**Impact:** Russia failed to order the planned moves to take Sweden and Rumania, costing them two potential builds and stranding their units in non-optimal positions. This also wasted Turkey's promised support for Rum.

**Diary Context:**

**Powers Involved:** AUSTRIA (openrouter-meta-llama/llama-4-maverick)

**Mistaken Strategy:** Austria planned a defensive posture while monitoring Italy and Russia. They intended to take Serbia.

**What Happened:** Austria ordered A SER - GRE, A VIE H, F TRI H.

**Impact:** By ordering A SER-GRE, Austria left Serbia open to be taken by Turkey. This, combined with their failed defense of Trieste due to Italy's tactical error (not being supported), resulted in Austria losing two supply centers and being severely weakened.

**Diary Context:**

_AUSTRIA (openrouter-meta-llama/llama-4-maverick) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Discussed mutual non-aggression and division of influence in the Balkans with Russia, but no clear agreement was reached. Exchanged assurances of stability and clear communication with France. Discussed demilitarized zones and mutual restraint with Italy, but they stopped responding.

#### 3. S1901M (Score: 7.0/10)
**Powers Involved:** AUSTRIA (openrouter-meta-llama/llama-4-maverick)

**Mistaken Strategy:** Austria intended to secure Serbia while maintaining a defensive posture against Italy and avoiding Galicia this turn. They agreed to a 'Bul for Turkey, Gre/Ser for Austria, no surprises' arrangement with Turkey and a peaceful border with Italy.

**What Happened:** Austria ordered A BUD - SER, A VIE H, F TRI H. They neglected to move into Greece and held their fleet, contradicting their stated intention to secure Greece/Serbia and leaving a critical supply center open.

**Impact:** Austria failed to capitalize on securing Greece uncontested, a crucial opening move. Their defensive stance and failure to move into Greece, especially with Italy moving away from the Adriatic, represents a missed opportunity and leaves them vulnerable relative to Russia's aggressive expansion.

**Diary Context:**

_AUSTRIA (openrouter-meta-llama/llama-4-maverick) Diary:_ Negotiation Summary: Reached agreements with Italy to maintain a non-aggression stance along our shared border and with Turkey on a 'Bul for Turkey, Gre/Ser for Austria, no surprises' arrangement.

France and England maintained a neutral stance, emphasizing stability and cautious decision-making.
Intent: Secure Serbia by moving into it, maintain a defensive posture against Italy, and respect the agreement with Turkey. Continue to monitor Russia's movements and be prepared to adapt to any changes in their stance. Keep a watchful eye on Germany's actions regarding Tyrolia.

**Powers Involved:** ITALY (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06)

**Mistaken Strategy:** Italy intended to order A TYR - TRI supported by A APU - TRI to secure Trieste.

**What Happened:** Italy ordered A TYR - TRI and A APU - VEN.

**Impact:** Italy failed to properly support their attack on Trieste, only receiving a 'hold' from Trieste because A APU moved to Venicia instead of supporting. This tactical error cost Italy a potential build in Trieste and weakened their coordinated strike with Turkey.
