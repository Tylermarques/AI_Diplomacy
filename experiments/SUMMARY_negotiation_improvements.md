# Summary: Negotiation Awareness Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Ignored Message Tracking
- Created `get_ignored_messages_by_power()` method in `game_history.py`
- Tracks when private messages receive no response
- Considers a message ignored if no response comes in same or next phase

### 2. Enhanced Negotiation Diary Prompt
- Added ignored messages context to show which powers aren't responding
- Added strategic guidance for dealing with non-responsive powers
- Added example scenario demonstrating adaptation to silence

### 3. Updated Agent Processing
- Modified `generate_negotiation_diary_entry()` to include ignored messages
- Added preprocessing for the new template variable
- Provides clear context about which messages were ignored

### 4. Improved Conversation Instructions
- Added awareness of powers that ignore messages
- Provided tactical guidance for getting responses:
  - Ask direct yes/no questions
  - Make public statements to force positions
  - Shift efforts to more receptive powers
  - Consider silence as potentially hostile

## Benefits
- AI powers now recognize when they're being ignored
- They can adapt their diplomatic strategies accordingly
- More realistic negotiation behavior
- Better resource allocation (focus on responsive powers)

## Technical Implementation
- Minimal, surgical changes to avoid breaking working system
- All prompts remain in separate files
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation and examples

## Testing
Created comprehensive test to verify:
- Ignored messages are correctly tracked
- Responsive powers are not marked as ignoring
- Multiple ignored messages are accumulated

All tests pass successfully.
