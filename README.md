# AI Diplomacy: LLM-Powered Strategic Gameplay

## Overview

This repository extends the original [Diplomacy](https://github.com/diplomacy/diplomacy) project with sophisticated AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Each power in the game is controlled by an autonomous agent that maintains state, forms relationships, conducts negotiations, and makes strategic decisions.

## Key Features

### ðŸ¤– Stateful AI Agents
Each power is represented by a `DiplomacyAgent` with:
- **Dynamic Goals**: Strategic objectives that evolve based on game events
- **Relationship Tracking**: Maintains relationships (Enemy/Unfriendly/Neutral/Friendly/Ally) with other powers
- **Memory System**: Dual-layer memory with structured diary entries and consolidation
- **Personality**: Power-specific system prompts shape each agent's diplomatic style

### ðŸ’¬ Rich Negotiations
- Multi-round message exchanges (private and global)
- Relationship-aware communication strategies
- Message history tracking and analysis
- Detection of ignored messages and non-responsive powers

### ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Order Generation
- BFS pathfinding for movement analysis
- Context-aware order selection with nearest threats/opportunities
- Fallback logic for robustness
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter)

### ðŸ“Š Advanced Game Analysis
- Custom phase summaries with success/failure categorization
- Betrayal detection through order/negotiation comparison
- Strategic planning phases for high-level directives
- Comprehensive logging of all LLM interactions

### ðŸ§  Memory Management
- **Private Diary**: Structured, phase-prefixed entries for LLM context
  - Negotiation summaries with relationship updates
  - Order reasoning and strategic justifications
  - Phase result analysis with betrayal detection
- **Yearly Consolidation**: Automatic summarization of old entries to prevent context overflow
- **Smart Context Building**: Only relevant history provided to LLMs

## How AI Agents Work

### Running AI Games

```bash
# Basic game with negotiations
python lm_game.py --max_year 1910 --num_negotiation_rounds 3

# With strategic planning phase
python lm_game.py --max_year 1910 --planning_phase --num_negotiation_rounds 2

# Custom model assignment (order: AUSTRIA, ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, RUSSIA, TURKEY)
python lm_game.py --models "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,gpt-4o,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,gpt-4o,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022,gpt-4o,claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

## Documentation

The complete documentation is available at [diplomacy.readthedocs.io](https://diplomacy.readthedocs.io/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

The latest version of the package can be installed with:

```python3
pip install diplomacy
```

The package is compatible with Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.

### Running a game

The following script plays a game locally by submitting random valid orders until the game is completed.

```python3
import random
from diplomacy import Game
from diplomacy.utils.export import to_saved_game_format

# Creating a game
# Alternatively, a map_name can be specified as an argument. e.g. Game(map_name='pure')
game = Game()
while not game.is_game_done:

    # Getting the list of possible orders for all locations
    possible_orders = game.get_all_possible_orders()

    # For each power, randomly sampling a valid order
    for power_name, power in game.powers.items():
        power_orders = [random.choice(possible_orders[loc]) for loc in game.get_orderable_locations(power_name)
                        if possible_orders[loc]]
        game.set_orders(power_name, power_orders)

    # Messages can be sent locally with game.add_message
    # e.g. game.add_message(Message(sender='FRANCE',
    #                               recipient='ENGLAND',
    #                               message='This is a message',
    #                               phase=self.get_current_phase(),
    #                               time_sent=int(time.time())))

    # Processing the game to move to the next phase
    game.process()

# Exporting the game to disk to visualize (game is appended to file)
# Alternatively, we can do >> file.write(json.dumps(to_saved_game_format(game)))
to_saved_game_format(game, output_path='game.json')
```

## Web interface

It is also possible to install a web interface in React to play against bots and/or other humans and to visualize games.

The web interface can be installed with:

```bash
# Install NVM
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/diplomacy/diplomacy.git

# Install package locally
# You may want to install it in a conda or virtualenv environment
cd diplomacy/
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

# Build node modules
cd diplomacy/web
npm install .
npm install . --only=dev

# In a terminal window or tab - Launch React server
npm start

# In another terminal window or tab - Launch diplomacy server
python -m diplomacy.server.run
```

The web interface will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

To login, users can use admin/password or username/password. Additional users can be created by logging in with a username that does not exist in the database.

### Visualizing a game

It is possible to visualize a game by using the "Load a game from disk" menu on the top-right corner of the web interface.

## Network Game

It is possible to join a game remotely over a network using websockets. The script below plays a game over a network.

Note. The server must be started with `python -m diplomacy.server.run` for the script to work.

```python3
import asyncio
import random
from diplomacy.client.connection import connect
from diplomacy.utils import exceptions

POWERS = ['AUSTRIA', 'ENGLAND', 'FRANCE', 'GERMANY', 'ITALY', 'RUSSIA', 'TURKEY']

async def create_game(game_id, hostname='localhost', port=8432):
    """ Creates a game on the server """
    connection = await connect(hostname, port)
    channel = await connection.authenticate('random_user', 'password')
    await channel.create_game(game_id=game_id, rules={'REAL_TIME', 'NO_DEADLINE', 'POWER_CHOICE'})

async def play(game_id, power_name, hostname='localhost', port=8432):
    """ Play as the specified power """
    connection = await connect(hostname, port)
    channel = await connection.authenticate('user_' + power_name, 'password')

    # Waiting for the game, then joining it
    while not (await channel.list_games(game_id=game_id)):
        await asyncio.sleep(1.)
    game = await channel.join_game(game_id=game_id, power_name=power_name)

    # Playing game
    while not game.is_game_done:
        current_phase = game.get_current_phase()

        # Submitting orders
        if game.get_orderable_locations(power_name):
            possible_orders = game.get_all_possible_orders()
            orders = [random.choice(possible_orders[loc]) for loc in game.get_orderable_locations(power_name)
                      if possible_orders[loc]]
            print('[%s/%s] - Submitted: %s' % (power_name, game.get_current_phase(), orders))
            await game.set_orders(power_name=power_name, orders=orders, wait=False)

        # Messages can be sent with game.send_message
        # await game.send_game_message(message=game.new_power_message('FRANCE', 'This is the message'))

        # Waiting for game to be processed
        while current_phase == game.get_current_phase():
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

    # A local copy of the game can be saved with to_saved_game_format
    # To download a copy of the game with messages from all powers, you need to export the game as an admin
    # by logging in as 'admin' / 'password'

async def launch(game_id):
    """ Creates and plays a network game """
    await create_game(game_id)
    await asyncio.gather(*[play(game_id, power_name) for power_name in POWERS])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(launch(game_id=str(random.randint(1, 1000))))
