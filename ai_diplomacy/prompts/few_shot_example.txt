EXAMPLE GAME STATE
Power: FRANCE
Phase: S1901M
Your Units: ['A PAR','F BRE']
Possible Orders:
  PAR: ['A PAR H','A PAR - BUR','A PAR - GAS']
  BRE: ['F BRE H','F BRE - MAO']

PAST PHASE SUMMARIES
- Your move A BUD -> SER bounced last time because Turkey also moved A SMY -> SER with support.
- Your support F TRI S A BUD -> SER was wasted because F TRI was needed to block Ionian invasion.

THINKING PROCESS
1. Consider enemy units, centers, and likely moves
2. Review your units, centers, and strategic position
3. Analyze recent conversations and phase summaries
4. Evaluate public/private goals and reality of positions
5. Choose best strategic moves from possible orders

Example thought process:
- Germany might move to BUR with support - consider bounce or defend
- Moving A PAR -> BUR is aggressive but strategic
- F BRE -> MAO secures Atlantic expansion
- Avoid contradictory or random supports
