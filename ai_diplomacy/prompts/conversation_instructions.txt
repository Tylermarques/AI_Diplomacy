NEGOTIATION MESSAGES

TASK
Generate one or more strategic messages to advance your interests.
Always prioritize responding to the messages in the "RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION" section.

Consider:
- Your current goals
- Relationships with other powers
- Ongoing conversations and the need to maintain consistent threads
- Messages that need direct responses in the "REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION" section

Message purposes can include:
- Responding to specific requests or inquiries (highest priority)
- Proposing alliances or support moves
- Issuing warnings or making threats
- Gathering intelligence about other powers' intentions
- Coordinating moves and suggesting tactical options
- Strategic deception when appropriate to your goals

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY JSON objects. One or more messages, each as a separate JSON object.
Do not include any text outside the JSON.

Required JSON structure:
{
  "message_type": "global" or "private",
  "content": "Your message text"
}

For private messages, also include:
{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "POWER_NAME",
  "content": "Your message text"
}

EXAMPLES

1. Global warning:
{
  "message_type": "global",
  "content": "COUNTRY's aggression in the south will not go unanswered."
}

2. Private cooperation proposal:
{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "RUSSIA",
  "content": "Perhaps we can coordinate against our mutual COUNTRY problem?"
}

3. Multiple messages:
{
  "message_type": "global",
  "content": "Let's focus on maintaining stability this turn."
}
{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "GERMANY",
  "content": "Secretly, I'm planning to move against COUNTRY. Can you support?"
}

4. Private inquiry and subtle warning (as Austria to Italy, suspecting Italy might eye Trieste):
{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "ITALY",
  "content": "Greetings, esteemed colleague. I trust your preparations for the season are going well. I'm currently evaluating my defensive needs, particularly around Tyrolia and Trieste. Any insights you might share on the general stability in our shared neighborhood would be most appreciated. A peaceful southern flank benefits us both, wouldn't you agree?"
}

5. Public statement of intent and private follow-up (as England, after taking North Sea and Norwegian Sea, aiming for St. Petersburg but wanting to appear non-threatening to Germany initially):
{
  "message_type": "global",
  "content": "England reaffirms its commitment to maritime security and the free passage of all neutral shipping in northern waters. Our recent naval deployments are purely to ensure these principles are upheld."
}
{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "RUSSIA",
  "content": "My friend, your northern ports are looking rather exposed. While my public stance is one of general peace, perhaps we could discuss ways to ensure *your* security in the region? I have no desire for conflict with you, but an unguarded St. Petersburg is a tempting target for others. Maybe a mutual understanding could be beneficial?"
}

6. Direct response to a specific proposal (as Italy responding to Austria's question about stability in the region):
{
  "message_type": "private",
  "recipient": "AUSTRIA",
  "content": "Thank you for your inquiry about regional stability. Regarding your concerns about Tyrolia and Trieste, I want to assure you that my army in Venice has purely defensive intentions. I agree that a peaceful southern flank benefits us both. In fact, I would propose we formalize this with a demilitarized zone agreement along our border, allowing both of us to focus elsewhere. Would you be amenable to such an arrangement?"
}

Your response must contain at least one valid JSON message block.
- Ensure recipient names are spelled correctly if sending private messages.
- Think strategically about *why* you are sending each message and what outcome you hope to achieve.
- When responding to a message, explicitly acknowledge what was said and reference specific points.
- For ongoing conversations, maintain thread continuity by referencing previous exchanges.
- If another power has made a specific proposal or request, address it directly in your response.
- When making agreements, be clear about what you are committing to and what you expect in return.
- If you need to quote something, only use single quotes in the actual messages so as not to interfere with the JSON structure.
